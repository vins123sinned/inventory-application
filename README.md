# inventory-application

A Node/Express inventory management app for all things produce. From cruciferous vegetables to exotic such as the now elusive Gros Michel banana, this imaginary business has it all.

This project contains categories and items, in which users can choose a category and peruse the items pertaining to that specific category. For example users can choose the Tropical Fruits category which contains every tropical fruit from the common mango to more obscure ones like the unique starfruit.

CRUD operations are also available, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete categories and items as they wish. As SQL is a relational database, the category and items table will be linked together accordingly with primary and foreign keys. All in all, this project will be my first full-stack website, with a sleek website and solid server side database to make the website fully functional online.
